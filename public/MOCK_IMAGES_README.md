# Mock Gallery Images

These HTML files can be viewed in your browser to simulate gallery images.
Since we had issues downloading real placeholder images, these HTML files serve as visual placeholders.

## Usage

1. Open each file in your browser to see how they look
2. In a real implementation, you would upload actual images to your Sanity studio
3. For production, replace with real images in the 'public' directory or upload to Sanity
